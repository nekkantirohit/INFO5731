yes truly unique uniquely done many ways dont want give anything would spoil anything really expect thats say ill shut ill say well worth watching great superhero great one watch overall fun visually pleasing brilliant watch recommendshangchi legend ten rings far surpassed expectations easily best marvel movie postinfinity saga know thats exactly saying much promising quality marvels next projects probably second best villain intimately tied origin new entertaining capable hero full potential story ties universe together teases upcoming events tantalising unexpected ways fight choreography point dialogue seeped cultural significance jokes land cgi best since thanos shangchi allout success marvel seems multiple ways critically financially really downfall times doesnt feel like much movie shangchi purely origin tied closely story ten rings instead ten rings movie featuring shangchi fine feels bit weird introduction mcu yes ten rings tied iron man films perfectly almost making whole aldrich killian thing better retrospect give shangchi high 810 promise moving rewatchesgave ten years live life get walked shadow marvel studios shangchi legend ten rings follows shangchi seemingly ordinary young man san francisco parks cars living alongside friend must confront past thought left behind drawn web mysterious ten rings organization marvel took big chance project course weve lesser known heroes end getting movie franchise within mcu shangchi one many know little known going wed get action scenes explore new territory within mcu managed shangchi legend ten rings unlike marvel movie yet destin daniel cretton takes new approach works wonders previous works short term 12 mercy heartfelt dramas something big like new territory incorporates style messages dysfunctional family dynamic serving character arc forming conflict much deeper random business guy wants rule world story easy connect understand character motives say theres lot pack story get muddy points pulls together retain everything simu liu fantastic title role previous watching hadnt seen anything skills emerging actor household name shangchi interesting character follow discovers recalls moments upbringing slowly piece together theres much made future installments well able get much tony chiuwai leung perfectly cast xu wenwu hes villain understand like dislike time hes flawed theres depth almost steals show end another showcase mad acting skills character ive thinking lot mainly hilarious awkwafina katy awkwafina one favorite actresses working right especially role farewell smashes katy typical comedic sidekick much fun one funniest jokes comes laughing hysterically maybe character come later got enough cant wait see also mention menger zhang xialing first role shes also great theyll next interesting technical standpoint impressive marvel movie stunning visuals cinematography isnt gray color scheme used though fall later bursting color probably know visual effects good come muddled cgi scene completely green screen nice see also marvel great themes score lately another great one along soundtrack paired best fight scenes whole mcu stunt choreography top notch beautiful intense look bus scene early best yet hard top shangchi legend ten rings really everybody agree refreshing captivating every way marvel taking big leaps new phase gets excited new installmentshangchi legend ten rings superhero origin story seems like chinese martial arts film next entrant marvel cinematic universe mcu many years ago saw crouching tiger hidden dragon found fight scenes literally unbelievable lot time shangchi often seems subtle fight scenes comparison action sequences like mcu superhero films origin story assumes familiarity mcu fact plays mostly nonmcu film liked simu liu plays shangchishaun son mobster xu wenwu played tony leung could quite easily subject film franchise due legendary characteristics shangchis mother ying li played fala chen also legendary kind character contrast eastern legendary figures western mcu legendary figures worked formers advantage latter often come across plastic toy figurines used sandpit small boys play plot concerns shangchishaun sought move shadow father become man thought pulled back wenwus orbit film mixes seriousness perhaps chinese martial arts films jokey style american hollywood films expected mcu film eventually fate world come play someone play hero save martial arts film juxtaposes frenetic fight sequences elegant fluid fight scenes particular charm times action sequences seem lifted disney live action family film enjoyable suspended disbelief speaking comedy found earliest instance aiming low laughs isnt uncommon mcu films warmed later instances instance amused character thespian sounded like liverpool reminisced took film saw teenager inspired get acting actor playing thespian seem familiar perhaps voice recognise name closing credits remembered role perhaps best known interesting aspect film subject matter ie asian superhero mostly asian cast another attempt hollywood crack important chinese market cooling relations us china unwelcome fly ointment hollywood studios trying make lot money chinese cinemagoers another question came mind whether ten rings based chinese legend marvel appropriation chinese culture tailored western audiences dont care cultural authenticity isnt former think could niche films mine authentic eastern legends myths could something might interest sinophiles would doubt reel long list films done might guessed wasnt first line see film fact wasnt even sure wanted see havent watched every line superhero films mcu maybe watch black panther stands think worth punt seeing id go far say seeing sequel would appealing wasnt tied avengers franchise furthermore would liked film remind part mcu managed least closing credits didnt welcome made first appearance said kind film could watch suitable break although didnt watch film 3d might worth sometimes extra cost ticket gives added value experience andsometimes doesnt notes self narrative logical gaps example shangchi attacked bus film dedicated memory brad allan think sure wassearching websites list supervising stunt coordinator reading closing credits reminded film shot australia isnt obvious watching good job studio think saw heard something abc australia asian australians got

still enjoyable movie likely watch cast good cinematography different usual stuff mcu offer like marvel didnt shy away using lot subtitles characters speaking lots chinese enjoyable id recommend marvel fan 710big disappointment black widow safe say anticipating better outing shang chi thankfully lived action films biggest plus point best scenes show choreography brilliant alongside kung fujohn wick style fights visuals typical marvel film solid always film however lost emotional resonance writing heart film mainly comes screenplay felt writing slightly lazy parts heart faded neither perfect terrible film solid one enjoyed even hard truly gravitate towards characters quote welcome circus wong rating 35mcu getting repetitive train movies new asian epic inspiring new generationreally hoping like shangchi couldnt mainly three reasons first one severe fact found bored especially last hour spent time hoping could ability skip 10 second like youtube second problem fact shangchi interesting character far movie treats surely potential clear marvel high future still hope movie think preferred least four characters protagonist finally plot various holes especially regarding ten rings criminal organization visuals action good wasnt enough like movie ps midcredit scene best movie really liked onefirst think people overhyping film bit like black panther best mcu origin film ever hell atleast 3 better origin stories existing theres lot good things shangchi differentiates film normal mcu film visuals breathtakingly beautiful unlike mcu film seen tone film resembles chinese action movies rather mcu refreshing first fight scenes incredible got super hyped quality falls later scenes becomes cgi monsterfest story predictable full narration exposition core emotional family drama dialogues powerful enough dig really deep craved many scenes performances solid awkwafina ben kingsley providing great comedic relief standout tony leung generates level empathy emotional suffering eyes legend overall really fun watch great people shoutingfeels like mash 10 old movies anc 20 plots weaved one film didnt enjoy much positives overall didnt leave feeling like id seen something special didnt feel like marvel film im diversity going different directions wasnt film loved would see characters bland uninspiring humour ok bit old old plot id guess youd call main theme felt bit daft cgi awesome graphics choreography costumes really nice parts genuinely beautiful film aint much doesnt matter think lot would hinge whether got gimmick liked didnt cool set pieces wanted achieve movie felt werent something thought interesting impressive always going one way pretty predictable didnt feel believe emotion found story bit stupid felt directionless trying much whilst achieving little felt long much longer run time wasnt film id recommend one felt disappointed maybe backwards though everyones saying makes black widow dont get thought black widow brilliant way better also seems asian bit funny everyone calls awkwafinalatest flick mcu shangchi magnificently assembled stellar cast like crazy rich asians stars awkwafina michelle yeoh combined interesting performance tony leung villainous mandarin simu liu lead welcoming addition marvel family martial arts skills adds evergrowing universe visuals fight choreography interesting soundtrack boot makes think like martial arts fantasy film rather typical marvel movie also took notice moral values quirks usually seen asian families began remind recent film crazy rich way terms valuing heritage roots learning past doesnt dictate become many years later 2019 san diego comiccon simu liu spoke like part marvel humble speak ive seen movie makes sense said panel citing black panthers chadwick boseman respect influence taking lead role chadwick helped open door took made audiences look like thats transpired mcu since 2008 cant wait see else shangchi go next recommendawakafina ruining another movie acting baaaad funny movie pretty boring much cgi makes ones head hurt see didnt accept movie china baaaad k thanks byeeeegood action movie excels delivering best fight scenes marvel cinematic universe thankfully nice long takes fixed shots camera spinning around theres great energy fights first bus scene stand even background actors little comfortable whats happening final fights great also really liked seeing chinese mythological creatures full expensive hollywood glory im chinese fascinated differences western eastern mythical creatures really got kick bad unfortunately lot meh bad simu liu fine similar captain marvel black panther discernible character feels like sidekick movie movie juggles many mostly pointless characters loses sight core character obvious emotional arc film awkwafina mostly pretty superfluous unnecessary sister iswell people movie main villain played legendary tony leung watchable welltony leung dont want call mandarin even though name primary chinese language butokay movie makes fun iron man 2s whitewashing sayben kingsley lot better version pretty bland pointless course theres second villain nondescript nameless dragon creature get big stupid cg fight end marvel ya movie also arranged baffling way numerous flashbacks happening 4050 minutes late movie also drags lot middle honest barely remember happened saw movie last night ugly know movie win asian representation movie almost entirely chinesecbcabc cast look mean set mostly china 50 dialog mandarin highest grossing movie north america meaningful get maybe watch lot east asian cinema already fact alone isnt enough personally mediocre movie dont think give big studios pass representation importantone real standouts movie fights scenes mcu really known interesting fight scenes really bland cliché shangchi brought something new loved every single fight scene well done paced super well destin daniel cretton directed amazing job directing fight scenes movie fight scenes movie probably best

anywaysaid watching black panther would cool asian cast similar asian cast movies like crazy rich asian 2018 romcom mulan 2020 bad comes shang chi first asian lead superhero movie ever premise martialarts master shangchi simu liu confronts past thought left behind hes drawn web mysterious ten rings organization shang chi succeed giving us good asian cast big blockbuster another failed attempt firstly action sequences choreography best marvel since captain america winter soldier 2014 martial arts focus action scenes shang chi beautifully choreographed get classic wirefufloating style crouching tiger also get jackie chan style utilization environment action action scene memorable stunning watch additionally action scenes avoid using lots cuts shaky cam grateful also clear actors rehearsed choreography making fights feel believable gratifying become typical mcu action sequence third act even still pretty enjoyable even isnt good first two acts cinematography bill pope matrix trilogy spiderman 2 3 scott pilgrim also excellent shang chi skyscrapers forests marvel movies never looked good shang chi bill pope director destin use lighting colours effectively allow genuinely beautiful shots music score joel p west also pretty good joel utilizes electronic sounds poprap songs scenes city uses traditional asian instruments mystical areas joels score captures scene poprap songs also quite good albeit memorable weeknd lamar black panther also love story exploration family shang chi whilst using asian stereotypes also doesnt overuse humour like marvels previous outing black widow 2021 use jokes every couple minutes ruin serious scene shang chi thankfully avoids thus allowing emotion scene linger longer still jokes though genuinely quite funny furthermore simu liu charismatic charming cool titular character shang chi think marvel succeeds casting department simu liu delivers making believe guy top tier martial artist also think simu gives good performance emotional moments well chemistry awkwafina plays shang chis friend katy great banter shang chi katy funniest scenes makes believe two friends years however tony leung plays main villain wenwu real mandarin one steals show tony leung phenomenal convey exact emotions character body language alone masterful acting biggest worry mcu origin movies villains lacklustre shang chi fall wenwu sympathetic also extremely fearsome also father shang chi makes conflict feel meaningful tragic wenwu straightup evil person still good like unfortunately shang chi suffers 3 villain problem razorfist played florian wenwus henchman doesnt get backstory dont mind much though mostly chase shang chi like 007 henchman also scene seem visibly worried wenwus health gives character depth hand 3rd villain death dealer mysterious assassin wenwu massive disappointment looks cool visibly distinct ten ring members relevant shang chis past amounts absolutely nothing moreover also 3rd hero shang chi katy shang chis sister xialing played menger zhang doesnt get enough interactions shang chi katy father wenwu feels like waste shame interactions shang chi katy enjoyable also doesnt interact dad wenwu missed opportunity character movie also pacing issue slows significantly second act featured lot talking exposition flashbacks felt could cut couple minutes overall shang chi legend ten rings asian cast movie waiting delivers action story characters exciting new addition mcu cant wait see shang chi finally get see asian avengers teambrief gap theatrical release considering black widow partial release marvel back theatres introducing characters new phase universe shang chi legend ten rings standalone film equally also serves important piece puzzle events linking web series upcoming movies

shot excellently simu liu awkwafina presented likeable character world building decent villain could fleshed story wasnt greatest acting wasthere overall would say story started great slowly crawled way finish line good movie marvels bestshangchi legend ten rings called asian black panther think inaccurate description two reasons first asian cultures explored indepth hollywood since 1970s latest ways subsaharan african cultures second point shangchi really mashup two hollywood subgenres around quite time ethnic discovery film stupid american tourist film ethnic discovery film recent type far interesting ultimately inspired alex haleys famous tv miniseries roots documents saga protagonist learns relearns heritage embarks quest fully embrace heritage good example think thunderheart fbi agent val kilmer comes appreciate fathers native american ancestry case lakota reservation famous fantasybased example star wars luke skywalker learns jedi blood surface shangchi definitely follows pattern unfortunately movies ethnic discovery theme undercut clichés even older hollywood storyline one film historian dubbed racial adventure film simply call stupid american tourist film common since 1930s film plot follows western almost always white characters visit exotic foreign land often purely exploitative purposes proceed reveal ignorance native culture always demeaning colonizing indigenous peoples since former forced make buffoons latter must bear humiliation taken seriously shangchi ethnic rediscovery film two chineseamericans san francisco learn one case relearn culture ancestors also racial adventure film essentially westerners travel china find midst culture clash white case titular character immigrant shangchi girlfriend otherwise fit role stupid american tourist unmistakably american accents annoying use slang pointless popculture references wisecracking sarcasm twist like kilmer thunderheart revert noble savage origins traveled ethnic place gone native incidentally theres one way shangchi legend ten rings differs dramatically black panther based nonwestern comic book sagas created white men black panther turns stereotypes black africans completely insideout giving us fantastic science fiction instead hackneyed jungle adventure shangchi usual kung pow hash orient presented ironically also way isnt terribly original fact theres another marvel movie one closely resembles black panther deadpool combine wacky humor serious even dark subject matter way thats jarring ultimately exasperating least deadpool felt freshexcellent cast story fine

slightly different others weve seen thought add things mentioned reviews struck watching slow motion musicsound slow mo something ive noticed chinese cinema past 2 decades use slow mo try poignant emotional overdone especially slightly cheesey background music labour point shangchi leans heavily several times found rolling eyes admittedly may notice b cgi thought wasnt great particularly start forest fight bus scene got better though overall climactic fight well rendered little disorientating c eastern mystical stuff tried shoehorn couple things honestly kinda like impression westerner would eastern history culture reminded little bit marvel ancient one caucasian lady asian clothes way danny rand tried spout mystical phrases iron fist tony leung michelle yeoh yuen wah three major players chinese cinema going way back 80s think great see particularly tony leung expressive eyes film know weird thing say yuen wah classmate jackie chan would liked seen latter honest would recommend check jackie sammo hung yuan biao youtube e fight scenes overall good particularly hand hand bus cgi one sharp aggressive brilliantly choreographed one forest though one overdone chinese cinema eye roller ie relationship developing result fight f humour great imo delivery great overall like said worth seeing youll probably enjoy girlfriend whos watch whole lot asian cinema ive seen
